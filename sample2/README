An example of explicitly specifying dependencies that ccfancybuild wouldn't
automatically pick up on. Here, the binary my_other_fun_executable needs the
source files somewhere/else/weird.cpp and somewhere/else/weird2.cpp compiled
into it. weird.cpp itself depends on one_of_ours.cc and ../reallyweird.h, while
weird2.cpp depends on example.cc and ../reallyweird.h.
